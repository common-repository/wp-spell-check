By socreatives

**Works Perfectly Amazing**

It helped us to find a lot of hidden content on the site that was hurting us with **SEO**. A lot of lorem ipsum here and there and multi-language details we didn't see. The template had many small things which we didn't use and they are all discovered. I like this plugin a lot. Thank you
Ali Tavanayan, Vancouver

**Truly a great plugin**

Truly a great plugin **for the developer** who does not write the content but is nevertheless responsible for proper spellings! Misspelled words create an image of poor design
